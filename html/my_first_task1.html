    <h3>HISTORY</h3>
    <P><blockquote>Every great story has a beginning. This one started in a small town in Bavaria, Germany. After starting out in his mother’s wash kitchen, Adi Dassler registered the ‘Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik’ in 1924 and embarked on his mission to provide athletes with the best possible equipment. Gold medals in Amsterdam (1928, Lina Radke) and Berlin were first rewards and milestones – and only the start of our story.</blockquote></P>

    <h3>WORK AT COMPANY</h3>
    <p><blockquote>Everything we do is rooted in sport. Sport plays an increasingly important role in more and more people’s lives, on and off the field of play. It is central to every culture and society and is core to our health and happiness.

        Key to our success are our people and our culture. They bring our identity to life, defined by our purpose, mission, and attitude.</blockquote></p>

    <h3>ABOUT THE TEAM</h3>
    <P><blockquote>Together we are a team of rebellious optimists, constantly challenging the status quo. We see possibilities where others only see the impossible. We serve the needs of our consumers, athletes, and communities. We train individually, and as a team, to inspire, innovate and grow. We are fair. We are authentic. Our game is built on trust. We live inclusivity every single day. We play to win in our mission to be the best sports brand in the world. Together, we are adidas.</blockquote></P>
